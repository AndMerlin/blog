Today, I'd like to reflect on what I've done during the 2024 year and share my gratitude to those who helped me.

**The start of 2024 was a whirlwind of activity for me. I enrolled in SET University, invested in the CompTIA Security+(Course+Exam), and seized the opportunity to join EC-Council C\|CT for a nominal fee. Additionally, I planned to renew my CKS Cert.**

# Let's begin in order.

During four months in SET University, I had a fantastic opportunity to work with many excellent teachers and great students. The program "Information and Cybersecurity Management" is interesting and structured and leaves you with a good background for further improvements. By the way, I forgot to mention that following the free advertisement, I enrolled in the Cisco Ethical Hacker course (free of charge). I will blame myself many times later on to place too many irons in a fire. In my free time, I was learning the Cisco course. And not only. This was a time when I was preparing for CompTIA Security+.

*   [January - pass CompTIA Security+ Certification](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_comptia-security-ce-certification-was-issued-activity-7152306116339593216-2CQ2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

CompTIA Security - Is another well-known vendor with a unique style. Very packed, no water, everything that needed. It is perfect for everyone, not only for Cyber Security specialists. It provides solid ground by itself. And as preparation for continuing to learn in the security field. It is definitely a good investment of time and money.

*   [April 2024 - SET University "Information and Cybersecurity Management" finished and graduated](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_i-am-feeling-a-mix-of-sadness-and-excitement-activity-7189176921207787521-S60D?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B1kkvOWozTt%2Bb8NDvufcanw%3D%3D)
*   [April 2024 - Cisco "Ethical Hacker" finished, passed the test, and graduated.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_ethical-hacker-was-issued-by-cisco-to-andriy-activity-7189958028836642817-Cu8w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B1kkvOWozTt%2Bb8NDvufcanw%3D%3D)

Cisco "Ethical Hacker" - gives a general, I'd say very foundational base, good for ones who'd like to jump into Penetration test / Red-team / White-hat. The course is well prepared and structured, and I didn't expect anything different from Cisco. I found it very simple and basic. I would recommend it to those who switch roles without knowledge of Cyber Security.

Remember I said my Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) expired. Here, I dedicated time to brushing up my knowledge and passed it. This is the second time I completed it. From my perspective, this one is a valuable way to spend my time. Refreshing the key concept of security in Kubernetes and, zooming out from day-to-day rut and looking at the possibility of improving Security for my clients.

*   [June - Pass Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_cks-certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-activity-7213827940055166976-c7Ai?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B1kkvOWozTt%2Bb8NDvufcanw%3D%3D)
*   [July - Pass EC-Council C\|CT (Certified Cybersecurity Technician)]([https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7216065682742878208-n4Z1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block])

EC-Council C\|CT (Certified Cybersecurity Technician) - I'd like to highlight the amount of information to learn in this prep course; it is huge, guys, huge, and it requires a lot of reading and watching. This one stands out from others I passed. I want to underline the labs. They should be completed if you want to pass the exam. The exam itself is a combination of theory and practice; in a short time, you have to show your knowledge and solve practical labs. The weight for Labs is higher than for theory. So you must be ready to make your hands dirty in a virtual (Windows / Linux environment). Do not expect to pass it with only theory. EC-Council said this is entry-level for Cyber Security. This is a very SOLID base for this. I blamed myself many times for not dedicating more time to preparation. I was in a rush as the exam should be done before a specific date. So I cram for a test, pulled all-nighters, and finished it. But this was something beyond me. I had underestimated how extensive the learning material was when enrolled in it. Tips: Plan more time for preparation.

# Having done the "program minimum" I switched gears and looked at my gaps in AWS.

*   [August - pass AWS Certified Data Engineer – Associate](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-was-activity-7228407612164182016-98XW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

As a practical DevOps engineer, the knowledge that was given me during preparation is the good to have. From time to time, I faced challenges analyzing data in S3, searching, and visualizing. In my opinion, the knowledge here is valuable for DevOps, which mainly works in AWS Cloud.

Surprisingly, AWS released two new Beta certifications in the AI(Artificial Intelligence) / Machine Learning(ML) field. With this colossal hype around ML and questions in my mind, "When will DevOps be replaced with ML?" and "Can current ML replace a human and destroy humanity?". I decided to dive into ML together with AWS. With a faint hope of achieving the "AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty" at the end of this journey.

*   [October - pass AWS Certified AI Practitioner](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_aws-certified-ai-practitioner-was-issued-activity-7240990792067035136-C8tx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

*   [October - pass AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecredly%2Ecom%2Fbadges%2F90f6da0d-b00e-4dc6-b19f-4add5e49fa9d&urlhash=vpHe&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

*   [December - pass AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-activity-7276563393581309953-UvCA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

AWS ML summary - ( AI Practitioner) General basics, a good start for further learning in this field. (Machine Learning Engineer) - More drilling into ML is a good step after ( AI Practitioner). And finally (Machine Learning – Specialty), the preparation was something. During my day-to-day work, I don't work with ML in any way and especially SageMaker. Preparation throws me away from the usual path. This certification requires detailed knowledge of Models / Parameters / Hyperparameters / Optimization methods and a lot more—deep familiarity with SageMaker and everything around it. There were so many abbreviations, terms, facts, and best-practice recommendations. Firstly, in my preparation, I made cards to memorize everything. Every day, I pushed my brain with facts that my brain didn't want to learn in any way. Re-read puzzling topics described by other people.

I finished this AWS ML journey, and I found answers to my questions: ML won't replace DevOps in two to five years, for sure; it will assist us and improve visibility. It will reduce monotonous tasks. Second answer: No, not now. In essence, all ML does statistically fetch/guess the next answer. There is no evidence for intellect yet. It mimics the brain but in a very good way. We will see significant improvements in AI assistants and knowledge searching, and I hope in personalized medical treatments. Everything above is only my opinion!!!

For AWS Certification, I chose AWS SkillBuilder. Two reasons: the first one is the same vendor as certification (I sincerely believe the same vendor will be able to prepare you better). The second one is that platforms like CloudGuru / Pluralsight did not fully cover the objectives and depth I expected. AWS has improved SkillBuilder drastically by adding CloudQuests / Jams two years from now. That is why I decided to give a chance to AWS Skillbuilder this time.

Nevertheless, I found many downsides in my journey. You may find many ways to prepare for certifications (Learning path guide: with a list of courses and labs) or Prep-course (almost the same) but packed in an umbrella course, so there is no one right way. Sometimes, you may find the same course in two or three versions. Why previous version should be next to the new one? My way: enroll in everything and do it one by one. Do not believe "duration" metric. I found it is too under-estimated. In most cases, I spend more time than expected just reading everything (flipping cards / expanding hidden blocks / pop-up messages, and so on). It is almost impossible to predict when you will finish preparation. Why? Each course gives you additional resources referencing the AWS knowledge base / FAQ and others. And I highly recommend skimming over them because the courses themselves are not enough for preparation. I always end up with a list of links collected from past courses.

Pros? Practical labs are a big plus for me as a practical technician. The latest feature (AI Client), which simulates talk with clients, is pretty cool. All topics, terminology, and abbreviations are the same as on the exam.  

Anyway, I will stick with SkillBuilder for a while. I will see how it goes.

By the way, during this year, I had an opportunity to share my knowledge in Cyber Security. I packed my knowledge into a short ~25-minute seminar for my coleage "[Cyber Security at Work and not Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj9wFTXRDZo&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)". The recommendations mentioned are helpful for everyone.

My 2024 year ended with unplanned achievements: "all AWS Certificates in my bucket." I'm eagerly looking into a new one and plan to continue improving my knowledge of Security and AWS. There is too much to learn.

There are no limits for improvements—the limit in our brain.

It is high time for gratitude.
