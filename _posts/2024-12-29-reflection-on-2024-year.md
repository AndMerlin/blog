Today, I'd like to reflect on what I've done during the 2024 year and share my gratitude to those who helped me.

**The start of 2024 was a whirlwind of activity for me. I enrolled in SET University, began working on my Australian Migration application, and started collecting evidence in parallel. During that time, I focused mainly on cybersecurity certifications, not only. This was a time when I was preparing for CompTIA Security+. I also planned to renew my CKS cert.**

**Let's begin in order.**

During four months in SET University, I had a fantastic opportunity to learn in “Information and Cybersecurity Management” program. I learned a lot about the cybersecurity landscape, security policies and standards, and the importance of security in general.

Also, SET University gave me ability to focus on learning. It was not a full-time program, so it allowed me to work and learn at the same time. Moreover, I was able to attend the program for a nominal fee. Additionally, I planned to renew my CKS Cert.

- [January - pass CompTIA Security+ Certification](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_comptia-security-comp...06116339593216-2CQ2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

**CompTIA Security** - Is another well-known vendor with a unique approach to cybersecurity. It provides a good foundation for cybersecurity professionals. It also has a good reputation in the industry. For me, it was a good opportunity to learn more about cybersecurity and prepare for a possible role switch to the cybersecurity field. It is definitely a good investment of time and money.

I mentioned earlier that I was preparing for the Australian Migration application. The key requirement is to have a positive skills assessment. In my case, it is ACS (Australian Computer Society). However, one of the key requirements is to have “Professional Development” evidence. Since I didn't have enough evidence, I decided to enroll in SET University. This was a good decision because I learned a lot and also got a certificate of completion.

Another key achievement was passing **Cisco “Ethical Hacker”** certificate.

- [May - Cisco Ethical Hacker](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_ethical-hacker-w...58028836642817-Cu8w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

**Cisco "Ethical Hacker"** - gives a general, I'd say very foundational knowledge about the security landscape and how hackers think and act. It is a good course for those who want to understand the basics of hacking and how to protect themselves. Also, it gives a good understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and how it can be used in practice. I highly recommend it to those who switch roles without knowledge of Cyber Security.

Remember I said my **Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)** cert was about to expire? I decided to renew it. It was a good decision because I learned a lot about Kubernetes security and also got a certificate of completion. It also gave me a good opportunity to review my knowledge and apply it in practice. I was also looking at the possibility of improving security for my clients.

- [June - Pass Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_cks-certified-ku...27940055166976-c7Ai?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- [July - Pass EC-Council C|CT (Certified Cybersecurity Technician)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7216065682742878208-n4Z1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

**EC-Council C|CT (Certified Cybersecurity Technician)** - I'd like to emphasize that the course provides a wide range of cybersecurity topics, including network security, cryptography, and incident response. It is a good course for those who want to learn the basics of cybersecurity and get a certificate. EC-Council said this is entry-level for Cyber Security. This is true. But, I would say it is a good course for those who already have some experience in IT and want to switch to cybersecurity.

My learning path was not only about certifications. In parallel, I was reading books, studying for the PTE Academic exam, and working on my ACS application. I was also working on improving my English skills, which is a key requirement for the Australian Migration application.

Here is the list of books I've read during the year:

- "Four Thousand Weeks" by Oliver Burkeman
- "The Laws of Creativity" by Joey Cofone
- "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
- "Deep Work" by Cal Newport
- "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" by Eric Jorgenson
- "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham
- "The Simple Path to Wealth" by JL Collins
- "The Millionaire Next Door" by Thomas J. Stanley
- "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Clason

Another key achievement was passing **CompTIA CySA+** certificate. It is a good course for those who want to learn more about cybersecurity and get a certificate. It is more advanced than Security+ and provides a good understanding of cybersecurity analytics and incident response.

- [August - Pass CompTIA CySA+](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_comptia-cysa-c...something?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Another key achievement was passing **CompTIA PenTest+** certificate. It is a good course for those who want to learn more about penetration testing and get a certificate. It provides a good understanding of penetration testing techniques and tools.

- [September - Pass CompTIA PenTest+](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andriynikitin_comptia-pentest...something?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

In the end of the year, I was able to get a positive skills assessment from ACS. It was a big achievement for me because it was a long and challenging process. I was able to collect all the required evidence and submit the application. I also got a positive outcome, which is a key requirement for the Australian Migration application.

I would like to express my gratitude to those who helped me during the year:

[SET University](https://www.linkedin.com/company/set-university/) - for the opportunity to learn and grow.

[OpsWorks Co.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/opsworks-co/) - for the opportunity to work on interesting projects and support my professional development.
